    <h1> news </h1>
   
      <p> we're recording our album for the 4th time. it's gonna be so unbelievably polished. i'll still wing every last solo. </p>

      <p> update on our album as of 11/4/2023 - yesterday we recorded all of our scratch tracks!! in one night!!! very exciting, very proud of the boys, pat mahoney, 
        who is helping us engineer/recprd/produce the record, and I suppose myself. I oughta pat myself on the back sometimes. Anyhow, what are scratch tracks, 
      you ask? Well they are basically recordings of us playing altogether as a live band. Those tracks will basically serve as a base and reference. 
    One at a time, we will record each member of the band, while they listen to the reference track. then at the end, we will remove the reference track audio, 
  and will have all of our individual recordings instead, creating the finished recording. since we aren't playing with a click track or metronome, 
this will be the best methodolgy, as we can build the track pieve by piece while having the tempo of the reference track to overdub to. Tomorrow, 
11/5, tim will begin to dub his drums over the reference track! on another date, we will then do bass, then guitar, and finally, vocals. 
Exciting times! </p>
