    <h1>12/14/2024:</h1>
    <p> yet another fresh start mother fucker. it's saturday, 12/14. slept a bunch. roughly 10-11 hrs. nyquil and melatonin put me out. 
    went out and got some zyns. they finally had 6mg wintergreen back in stock! also got the usual from aldi - oats, greek yogurt, and 
    assorted fruit. life is so grand. i've been a hermit lately. not going out helps me stay sober. you go to hang with friends, and 
    someone's busting out beer and pot. you go to a concert, they're serving beer. i know it's lame, but i'm almost six months sober on 
    this go-around, and i'm not letting myself fall off the wagon again. plus, it's a peaceful life as a hermit. i hang with my cats. 
    poke at my guitar and piano. read books. listen to my favorite songs. watch police videos on youtube. eat my big snake meal every 
    evening. what more could a man want or need? i guess love wouldn't be so bad, but i am very much at peace being single. i'm 
    ultimately looking for a life partner, so there's no rush to find the person i am going to spend the rest of my life with. 
    i'd also miss my solitude as a single man sometimes, i'm sure, so might as well enjoy it. anyhow, i'm trying to keep these blog 
    posts a bit more short and sweet, so it's about time to shut up. i'm gonna strum a lil guitar and rot on the couch. maybe renew my 
    world of warcraft subscription. break my daily fast around 5-6 pm. lookin' forward to dinner. ciao. </p>
