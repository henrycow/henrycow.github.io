    <h1>10/29/2024:</h1>
    <p> yet another fresh start mother fucker. it's tuesday, 10/29. i'm starting a fast. the evening of 11/3 will be 5 days, and that's 
      the goal. i'll report back when i feel like it. i'm hoping to reach a state of mind akin to enlightenment. honey, we're having zen 
      for dinner. and water. plus a zyn. ciao. </p>

    <h1>10/30/2024:</h1>
    <p> hello it's wednesday, 10/30. another day of the fast is underway. we're close to 36 hours in. i resisted candy and cupcakes 
      today. it was tough but i'm eager to have another successful extended fast. it's been too long. tired of starting one and failing 
      over and over again. anyhow, time to enjoy some 'puter time. maybe strum guitar if i'm lucky, but inspiration has been few and 
      far inbetween. ciao. </p>

     <h1>11/02/2024:</h1>
    <p> hello! it's saturday, 11/02. my aforementioned fast lasted about 60 hours. then i decided i just really needed some food. 
      it had been a long time since i had done a 48 hr fast. probably best to work up in increments to 5 days. next time i'll prob 
      shoot for a full 3 days (72 hrs) since i was pretty close to that marker. anyhow, been up since like 5:22 am. fed pat's cats. 
      basil knocked his bowl off the counter and I had to do some cleaning. then i came back to my apt and rotted on the couch. 
      listened to relayer by yes in it's entirety with headphones on. been a long time since i heard that album. i'd give it a 
      7/10. gates of delirium fucks. sound chaser is solid but a bit too long. to be over kinda sucks. anyhow, now i am seated at 
      the 'puter. prob gonna play WoW or some other classic blizzard game. scour aldi for wet cat food again later. ciao. </p>

     <h1>11/02/2024:</h1>
    <p> hello again. it's sunday, 11/03. Went to bed around 7 pm last night. up around 4:45 am. of course there is always some nightly 
      insomnia. spent around 1.5 hrs awake around midnight. I always get very sleepy after my daily large meal. i've been trying to push 
      the meal back to 7:30-8:00 pm so i sleep around 9, but not always in the mood to eat that late. anyways, aldi 
      did not have the wet cat food back in stock yesterday. settled for friskies at kroger. more expensive, but the cats love it. if 
      they're happy then i'm happy. i have been so lazy lately. yesterday was no exception. can't bring myself to do much. no serious 
      writing of music. maybe today will be different. or i'll at least play some games and not just rot on my couch on the phone rifling
      thru erowid. anyhow, it's 6:49 am. gained an hour of fun today. gonna brew my first cup of coffee in a couple. then back to the 
      'puter. ciao. </p>
