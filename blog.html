    <h1>12/14/2024:</h1>
    <p> yet another fresh start mother fucker. it's saturday, 12/28. i keep starting fresh on this blog. kinda defeats the purpose, no? 
    i guess i just feel like a new being every couple weeks, even though nothing at all changes in my life. nothing. i work very hard to 
    make sure everything stays the same. it's peaceful. and maybe autistic. who knows for sure. anyhow it's been a lazy day. can't bring 
    myself to do much. but hey, that's life sometimes. can't be motivated and gung-ho all the time. anyways i kinda wanna keep these short 
    and sweet. mostly just wanted to check in. life's good. almost six months no booze, and one year no pot. fridge and pantry are chock 
    full of the usual daily meal - oats w/ cinnamon, granny smith apples, frozen strawberries and blueberries. mini-fridge is full of 
    zyns. got nothing to do, not even laundry. played some guitar and piano today. nothing serious composed, but at least i played. might 
    renew my WoW sub and go back down that rabbit hole yet again. i need a vice. i miss getting high and drunk. we'll see. anyways, cats got 
    fed an early dinner, and i'll do the same for myself in about 30 mins. ciao! </p>
