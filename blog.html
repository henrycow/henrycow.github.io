    <h1>10/9/2023:</h1>
    <p> today i am getting this site worked out foundationally. getting the skeleton together. i am also thinking about a girl. and water. going for a sip right now. </p>
    
    <h1>10/10/2023:</h1>
    <p> today I am somber. feeling down. i am too sensitive and emotional for one lifetime, some days. 
      wishing my emotions and relations with certain people weren't so complicated. i can rationalize
    how i should feel all day long, but my sappy heart does not care for logic and reasoning.
  i'm trying to distract myself from what's on my mind, but also trying to simply face it at face value.
which approach i choose really wavers from moment to moment. but getting it out on a diary helps.
i won't get too personal about it, since this is a public domain. i don't want to overshare, 
or make anyone's identy known. i'm missing someone, though! quite a bit. i cherish them very much,
but sometimes it ain't so simple. In other news, I've got some music going. I've listened to three of tyler, 
the creator's albums today. re-listening, for the record, you scoundrels. I always try and dig
his new releases whenever they pop up. right now, i think igor is my favorite. i adore the jazz tinges
all over that album. some excellent chord work and modal solos. i'm lead to believe a lot of the playing
is tyler himself. that man has come a loooong way as a musician. it's inspiring. gives me hope,
and reminds me to practice. looking back on his album, bastard, it's simply jaw dropping,
what he can do now. anyways, i think i'll get this blog post uploaded, and then try to play some acoustic
guitar. distract myself a bit. ciao. </p>
    
     <h1>10/11/2023:</h1>
    <p> today was alright! i'm still a bit somber. it seems to come in seasons for me. usually it's not just not
      for a day. but i am feeling fortunate to have rekindled a friendship today. my emotions about the whole 
    thing are a bit complex, and sometimes i let my emotions get the best of me. i certainly did last week.
  no matter what i feel though, they are above all else one of my best friends, and i don't want to let
some of my emotional thoughts to overshadow that. there's no need to let my feelings bleed into the
friendship like i did. a lot of what i feel is ultimately subjective, and i imagine certain feelings
will pass eventually. we'll see i suppose. anyhow i felt flowers were a nice gesture to rekindle, and 
they were very understanding and gentle with me. everyone deserves a person like that in their lives. fortunate
that the rich tapestry of my life is embroidered with that kind of human. in other news, i am busy as fuck at work. 
but work is over now, and it is past 9pm. i've had a calm evening. cleaned a bit. wrote a tune! i feel strongly
about the instrumentation, but i still need to figure out what i'm going to sing. going for an alex g kinda thing. had 
candy for dinner. watching trash television (floribama shore). my life is much better than i like to think. it ain't so 
bad at all. adios! </p>


<h1>10/12/2023:</h1>
<p> to be determined. but i have a good feeling about it. - the day wasn't so bad! work has been crazy busy. we're down people on our team, and it was my turn 
  to pick up some of the slack. double-triple the work for the same pay. fun. but..staying busy does keep me out of trouble. i have a tendency to
  get myself into trouble and make some pretty awful, self-destructive decisions. especially with idle time. usually it manifests into rampant drug
  and alcohol abuse. fortunately i have been clean for a bit now. but there's always tomorrow. it's a day by day ordeal. well, i do take kratom.
  that plant falls in a strange gray-area. is it a drug? well it does act on your opiod receptors and gives you the same withdrawl symptoms as 
  heroin does. the last couple times i quit were some of the worst times of my life. buckets of sweat. didn't sleep for two weeks. literally. 
  felt suicidal. but..it doesn't really get you high. just a slight and subtle euphoria and energy boost. it's a strange plant. anyhow, some people 
  would argue that i am still off the rails, others not so much. it's up for debate with kratom. but..since i was so busy today, there was no time 
  to really get myself into trouble. outside of work i played some guitar and bass. been watching ample amounts of trash-reality television. my 
  favorite. ate a bit more than usual, which is good. i'm about 10 pounds underweight. but..i mostly just ate sugar cookies. i'm like an unsupervised 
  child living out here on my own. it's peaceful though. i'm in in bed by 9:30-10:00. it's been cozy and peaceful today. certain people on my mind. oh,
  i also went on a date! her name is lauren. we walked around a park. had some great conversation. talked about spirituality, life, and books. very sweet 
  woman. very attractive too, but, there was no spark. i don't intend on talking to her again. dating is such a strange thing in that way! i have 
  met so many people recently for the first time, and then never again. only a couple people have really touched me in a way where i could 
  daydream about being lovers. chemistry is a hard thing to come across. it's mostly pure chance. i suppose i won't find someone i have true 
  chemistry with if i don't try though! i'll keep looking. ciao. 
</p>   


<h1>10/13/2023:</h1>
<p>today has been a fine day. work was busy, but not unbearable. i cracked my laptop screen, so i had to go into the office for the first half of my day. got 
  a new laptop. well..i reckon it's refurbished, used by a prior employee. don't think it was brand-new per se, but i don't mind. as long as it works. 
  that's really my mantra for many things in life, particularly with all my musical gear. i just want functional. all those bells and whistles,
  or as the french say, "accoutrements", not my thing. i like simple and functional. and the laptop is that much. anyhow, went home on my lunch break, 
  and then work was over. some days the time drags, other days it flies by. time is a strange concept. i reckon my life will feel both short and long 
  when i'm facing my death and mortality one day. i keep envisioning myself dying at 45. i reckon 20 more years would make for a full life. all i 
  really want is to be in true, deep love one more time. get a lil cult following for flaming peace. watch the cats live a full life. then i would 
  be happy to go. death seems comforting. anyways, outside of work, i made a lil musical tune. forced myself. i don't really feel like being creative 
  a lot of days. it was an alright tune. i always seem to get some love for my music on instagram, which is validating. aside from that, stu came by, 
  and we went to a DIY art venue/garage called garage 129! it is a very lovely joint. i adored it. DIY sound set up. paintings on the wall. garage door open,
  warm fall air cascading in and out. an old video game console plugged into a television, sitting idle on some racing car game. it was a vibe, 
  as the kids say. my band, flaming peace, is playing there on 11/10, and i'm very excited! there is nothing i love more than music and playing it 
  live. other than blonde women, maybe. both are very fulfilling. anyhow, i'm back to blogging, with some sort of parking wars style show on the 
  television. i think i'm going to try my hand at some more music making tonite. it is a fine life! i also had some more sugar cookies today. 
  a man's gotta eat. ciao.

<h1>10/28/2023:</h1>
<p>
  hey hi hello! tyler green here. it's been a lil over a couple weeks! i think i was simply extra depressed. didn't have the energy to do much, 
  was going to bed super early, lying down by like 8 pm. i suppose i am just simply a lil deranged. and emotional. sometimes i also just simply 
  just simply don't feel like doing much. i go to work, come home, feed the cats and clean their litter, play guitar for 30 mins, and i am all 
  tapped out. anyhow, these last couple weeks! what have i been up to..erm..a few things! the flaming peace gig on 11/10 at garage 129 in franklinton 
  is approaching steadfast. got a couple band practice sessions in. the band is sounding tight. we're gonna kill it at this show. hopefully there 
  is a lovely blonde woman that can see me in my mrpime, doing my thing, and she'll just be so swooned. over the moon. but being alone ain't so bad 
  either. i do miss sharing my life with another person sometimes. looks like i'm going back and forth. whatever happens, happens. still leaning 
  towards finding the love of my life though. dating apps suck. meeting people in person does not suck. anyways. what have i been doing otherwise..
  I have been home a lot! making quite a bit of music, mostly songs that are for consideration only as solo tyler green releases, but there was one 
  flaming peace style song that i whipped up. we'll see if the band adopts it or not. i've also been going on a lot of walks around the neighborhood. 
  it's good for my mental health, and i love getting some fresh air and seeing lovely ol' clintonville. it really is a wonderful town to live in. 
  i've still been watching a lot of trashy reality tv. lately a lot of little women: atlanta, and LA. i don't think i've been on a date since the 
  jesus freak. she was something. beautiful though. oh, my birthday! it was on monday, 10/23. i'm 26 now. getting to be ancient. i took 10/20 thru 
  10/29 off work as a lil bday present. just about at the end of my PTO. time flies. i spent the time doing a lot of the same. took a nap almost 
  every day. went out to eat with my father a couple times. also saw my mother for the first time in a very long while. to keep it simple, i don't 
  really like her. but she had money to give my for my bday, which i needed to help cover a couple of tattoos that i got on thurs, 10/26. honestly 
  though, she was nice to me this time around. doesn't make up for the years that she simply wasn't, but some things in life need to be taken day 
  by day. i also saw some of my friends, we wnt to texas roadhouse for dinner as a sort of funny joke, but it was also a genuinely good time and meal. 
  i got a burger, fries, and a slice of cheesecake. thanks, will, for the cheesecake! otherwise, i just ran some extra errands. simeon got some shots. 
  he has been extra cuddly ever since. i'm not sure if distemperment shots have a literal implication in what they do, but if so, he is now 
  distempered. he usually never sleeps with me, but he has been a lil bit. anyhow, that is really it! all in all i'm feeling okay. always up and down, 
  but i never really have anything truly worth complaining about. my friend luke is having a halloween party tonight. i'm feeling like a homebody, 
  not really in the mood to go. i'll push myself to though. i don't have to stay all night. also released my first solo track today. here's the 
  link for any of y'all that care enough to check this blog out - <a href="https://dogconnoisseur.bandcamp.com/track/love-of-my-life">love of my life</a> . I suppose i'll leave on that note, maybe go for a walk, reheat some pizza. ciao!
