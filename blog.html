<h2> blog - diary - trail of tears</h2>

    <h1>10/9/2023:</h1>
    <p> today i am getting this site worked out foundationally. getting the skeleton together. i am also thinking about a girl. and water. going for a sip right now. </p>
    
    <h1>10/10/2023</h1>
    <p> today I am somber. feeling down. i am too sensitive and emotional for one lifetime, some days. 
      wishing my emotions and relations with certain people weren't so complicated. i can rationalize
    how i should feel all day long, but my sappy heart does not care for logic and reasoning.
  i'm trying to distract myself from what's on my mind, but also trying to simply face it at face value.
which approach i choose really wavers from moment to moment. but getting it out on a diary helps.
i won't get too personal about it, since this is a public domain. i don't want to overshare, 
or make anyone's identy known. i'm missing someone, though! quite a bit. i cherish them very much,
but sometimes it ain't so simple. In other news, I've got some music going. I've listened to three of tyler, 
the creator's albums today. re-listening, for the record, you scoundrels. I always try and dig
his new releases whenever they pop up. right now, i think igor is my favorite. i adore the jazz tinges
all over that album. some excellent chord work and modal solos. i'm lead to believe a lot of the playing
is tyler himself. that man has come a loooong way as a musician. it's inspiring. gives me hope,
and reminds me to practice. looking back on his album, bastard, it's simply jaw dropping,
what he can do now. anyways, i think i'll get this blog post uploaded, and then try to play some acoustic
guitar. distract myself a bit. ciao. </p>
    
     <h1>10/11/2023</h1>
    <p> we'll see how that day pans out </p>
