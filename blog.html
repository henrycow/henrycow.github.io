    <h1>11/08/2024:</h1>
    <p> yet another fresh start mother fucker. it's friday, 11/08. got work in a couple hours. got up early today as per usual. 
      gonna rot on the couch until work, and probably rot on the couch afterwards. maybe strum a lil guitar. i've been working 
      on a couple alex g covers - pretend and i wait for you. haven't had any creative inspiration or energy, so i'm hoping 
      that recording a couple good covers will light that fire in my soul again. oh well. creative inspo comes and goes. i'll 
      get a burst of it for a few months. then i'll feel like nothing i create is any good for a few months. that cycle will 
      repeat a few times over, and then i will die. hopefully after 70 years when my cats are both 72 and i am 97. anyways, 
      time to rot on my phone and rifle thru some erowid reports. as a sober individual, i live vicariously thru those brave 
      soliders on erowid. ciao. </p>

     <h1>11/17/2024:</h1>
    <p> another day is upon us! well it's well on it's way to being over. it's 4:42 pm. i've been feeling considerably better 
    mentally, well not every day, but more days than usual. anyways. i've been making 
    more music. that's good. restrung my nylon acoustic guitar yesterday. that was an absolute pain in the ass. the new strings 
    sound and feel fantastic though! it's been inspiring me to play the piece of shit 80 dollar guitar. for 80 dollars, i feel 
    like i got a fantastic deal. no fret buzz and good action. doesn't always stay in tune the best, but it's not too awful. 
    the weather is nice today. i'm cat sitting for pat, one more week of that. his cats, josie and basil are angels. i love them. 
    it's a fun and easy side gig, and feels good to do a favor for a friend as well. welp. i don't wanna ramble too much. 
    i'm gonna strum some guitar while watching youtube. proper semi-productive sunday rotting. ciao.</p>

     <h1>11/27/2024:</h1>
    <p> hello! it's 4:53 pm. boss let us out a lil early as a thanksgiving treat. got thurs-mon off. took PTO on monday to milk that 
      time off work. hopefully it's slow for my backup. taking off work is of course earned and deserved, but i hate thinking that 
      people that i like and consider to be my friend are going to potentially be slammed with my work cause i'm off. oh well, 
      i suppose it goes both ways. no one should feel like they can't take PTO for any reason. we're working until we die with the 
      way that the working class is getting stiffed. might as well cherish every single day that you don't have to work and 
      get paid for it. anyhow, life has been so very good to me. mental health is still mostly better. i mean it's always kinda 
      shitty, but it's not miserable as of the last couple weeks. food in the fridge. rent paid. just got a couple new tats the other 
      day. been playing more guitar. i've also had over a month no sugar/candy/junk, etc! well, aside from sugar from fruit. I eat 
      alot of blueberries and strawberries. also in a week i will be 5 months sober from booze! i'm on top of the world. in other news, 
      i've essentially been off social media for over a month. no dating apps, those are hell. hopefully the love of my life goes to aldi, 
      or maybe gets hired where i work. otherwise i might be single forever. but i've been at peace alone. working very hard to spend all 
      my time alone with the cats, at peace. even finally mustered the gusto to text my dear friend and neighbor to please stop knocking 
      on my door. i love him, i know he probably thinks i'm alone and don't hit him up cause i'm sad or something, but really i just simply 
      could spend every day alone. i hate hanging out with people. i don't wanna call. i just wanna listen to music, watch youtube videos, 
      and ponder. i nourish myself. alright, that's a lil too many words for one day's blog. i'm gonna sit around and rot. maybe play a lil 
      guitar or piano. ciao.</p>
