    <h1>10/9/2023:</h1>
    <p> today i am getting this site worked out foundationally. getting the skeleton together. i am also thinking about a girl. and water. going for a sip right now. </p>
    
    <h1>10/20/2024:</h1>
    <p> a little over a year after my first blog post (10/10/2023) I am startin' over fresh! deleted all my previous stupid sappy blog posts.
    looks like i was hung up on a girl. also on life. no one needs to read that melancholic self pitying bullshit. until i get sad and feel like
    oversharing again. but in my old age (i'm 27 in 3 days!) i am trying to refrain from oversharing. be a lil more mysterious and reserved. 
    i'm a bit of a recluse and hermit these days so why overshare to my audience of zero. anyways, what's happening in my life? i'm going out 
    of my way to make sure almost nothing is happening. i just sit in my apartment with the cats. playing videogames often, and making music 
    sometimes. not as often as i'd like. on the subject of music, i also quit flaming peace, the band i was in. I took 10/18 thru 10/27 off work, so i have the luxury of doing extra nothing for now. there is no 
    other way that i'd rather spend my birthday week. it's gonna be beautiful. oh, i've also been sober from booze for over 100 days! no marijuana in 
    ages. also no cigs in over 100 days! (although i do use zyns - but they seem to be a much better alternative). now i am just working to kick 
    my on and off sugar/food binging habit. since i don't binge drink anymore, my brain wants to fill the void with sugar. i've been doing mostly 
    good the last 3ish months, but there have been some slip ups, and some gnarly binge days. this is my last bastion though! once i get consistent 
    in my eating, i will have conquered the world. did i say something about not oversharing anymore? i can't remember. anyways that is all that i feel like typing for now. overall life is great, although i am sleepy 
    all of the time, things could be much worse. in fact, i think i'll go lie down now. ciao! </p>

     <h1>10/24/2024:</h1>
    <p> good evening! it's 5:40 PM here. Getting chinese for dinner with my dad and brothers at 6:30 at lucky dragon on high st. my bday
    was yesterday (10/23) and so this is one of our handful of annual gatherings of the boys of the family. well i guess we're all men now.
    my bday was okay. i've been trying to quit sugar and binge eating again, so yesterday was pretty awful regarding cravings. it's been bad 
    this last week or so, i last had sugar and overate candy on 10/17, so it's only the first week or so in. birthdays and holidays are always 
    rough for me with cravings to go wild on junk food. i wish i were like the average person that is able to go wild on their bday with cake 
    and what not, but if i do that, i won't stop. i'll binge sugar again more nights shortly after, and it will snowball. doesn't help that i have 
    been off work all week so i'm not as distracted as i usually am. my thoughts have had ample time to wonder and it's been rough. either way, 
    i am soldiering thru! day 8 off sugar (aside from natural sugar from fruit) and the worst of it will be over soon. i've checked the menu for 
    lucky dragon online and got a couple healthy picks planned out. vietnamese spring rolls and chicken and broccoli w/ steamed rice. bringing 
    my own hot sauce as well. i was gonna go for general tso's, but i had no clue that a lot of those sauces have so much sugar in them! it's 
    wild how sugar is in so many foods. i've been doing well dieting otherwise. i had a really nasty 4-5 junk food binges in the last 3 weeks or so 
    and wanted to get a lil calorie deficit going to undo those days. i'm shooting for roughly 1300-1500 calories a day and have been keeping up 
    with it! i'm already a thin guy so some would view this as over the top, but i feel like i need to balance out all the extra sugar calories. 
    i could deal with it being from real food, but not junk. i want to get back to where i was prior to those binges. fortunately i didn't set myself 
    back too much at all. some people go off the rails daily for a month straight. ultimately though, i want to get to a place here soon where I 
    don't think about food and what i'm eating. i'm hoping once the sugar cravings pass and i'm consistently eating healthy every day, and eating 
    1500-1900 cals, i'll settle into a good grind. i'm a skinny and very lazy couch potato so 1800-1900 cal is my TDEE. I just need to make sure 
    that more often than not I am closer to 1900 cal. too long of a deficit and i set myself up for binge/restricting cycles, which i do struggle 
    with. i'm thinking that i'll end the daily deficit at the end of october. anyways, so much for not oversharing, right? this is my personal diary at 
    this point anyhow. if a couple people stumble across this i don't really care. i have reached a point recently where i have been very happy alone 
    and don't very much care for what others think. it's been liberating. i used to care way too much about what people thought. anyhow, that's 
    about all i wanna type tonight. just needed to write some of that out to help with my mental health. it's been a rough week but things always 
    get better. i've never been in a funk permanently. this too shall pass. i'm looking forward to seeing my dad here soon. i love that guy. 
    i played some world of warcraft and warcraft 3 today, and will probably game some more after dinner with my brother dante. we like to play 
    pubg. keeping myself busy and distracted thru video games and youtube really helps with my wondering thoughts. well, that's a wrap. ciao! </p>
